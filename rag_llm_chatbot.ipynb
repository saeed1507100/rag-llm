Wheat\\nMore than 80% of wheat in Bangladesh is grown in rice-wheat rotation of which \\nabout 50% is planted late. Late planting causes a significant yield loss in every year. Wheat is often late because of delayed harvesting of T. Aman rice, longer time for land preparation, unavailability of labourers, late monsoon and some cases of excess moisture in the soil. The optimum growing mean temperature is about 25\\n  0C. It \\nfavours range of temperatures between 200 and300C with minimum temperature of 3-\\n40C and maximum of 30-320C. Well distributed rainfall ranging from 40-110 cm is \\noptimum for wheat growth. The area of wheat during 2011-12 is 3.58 lac hectares with total production of about 10 lac tones with an average yield of about 2.78 t/ha.
